### Getting started

**Either:**

1. Go to Tags
2. Search for the newes version and download it
3. Extract it
4. Run it or run `install.sh`
5. Thats it.

**Or:**

- Build it yourself as explained further on

> Note: I do not recommend to use a self-built version of scrypt-lite.



#### How to build



**Requirements:**

- linux
- git
- g++ (8.3.0)



**Building:**

- Clone the repository
- Run the `build.sh` file in the repository root. If everything succeeds you will find the binary in the `bin/` directory. You can move it to `/bin` or `/sbin` or somewhere else to use it from terminal just like `ls` or `cd`.
